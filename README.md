# BigIcons Papient

**BigIcons Papient** is an icon package for BigLinux, based on the Papirus icon theme. It uses Papirus icons in most categories, except for Mimetypes and Places, where specific customizations are made. Additionally, some other categories have modified icons to better fit the needs of BigLinux.

In the end, the project generates a package with **four icon themes**:

- **BigIcons Papient**: features gray tones in monochromatic icons.
- **BigIcons Papient Dark**: dark variant of the Papient theme with gray-toned monochromatic icons.
- **BigIcons Papirus**: keeps monochromatic icons without any tonal variation.
- **BigIcons Papirus Dark**: dark variant without tonal variation in monochromatic icons.

We extend our sincere thanks to the **Papirus** project team for their invaluable contribution. The Papirus icon theme is widely recognized as the most complete and well-maintained theme by the free software community, serving as the solid foundation for various adaptations, including BigIcons Papient.
